# People Analytics

**People analytics** - using statistical insights from employee data to make talent management decisions.

People analytics has focused mostly on employee attribute data, of which there are two kinds:
- _Trait:_ facts about individuals that don’t change, such as ethnicity, gender, and work history.
- _State:_ facts about individuals that do change, such as age, education level, company tenure, value of received bonuses, commute distance, and days absent.

Relational data, on the other hand, captures, the communications between two people in different departments in a day. **Relational analytics** is the science of human social networks.

The relationships employees have with one another—together with their individual attributes—can explain their workplace performance. The key is finding “structural signatures”: patterns in the data that correlate to some form of good (or bad) performance. 

Organizational leaders can look at structural signatures in their companies’ social networks and predict how, say, creative or effective individual employees, teams, or the organization as a whole will be.

# Machine Learning

While training models, you are taking your description of something and telling it what [label](http://bit.ly/quaesita_island) it should get.

## Supervised learning:

**Labels (dependent variable).** The label is the right answer. 
It’s what we’d like the computer to learn to output when we show it for ex. a photograph of people faces, which is why some people prefer the term ‘target’, ‘output’, or ‘response’.

**Features (independent variables).** Some descriptions of your labels.

When the target variable that we’re trying to predict is continuous, such as in our housing example, we call the learning problem a regression problem. Super simply, linear regression is a way we analyse the strength of the relationship between 1 variable (our “outcome variable”) and 1 or more other variables (our “independent variables”).

When y can take on only a small number of discrete/categorical values, we call it a classification problem. 
Categorical variables are just variables that can be only fall within in a single category. Good examples are days of the week, or types of fruits. For these data we usually use models that predict probability of a thing falling into one type or the other. This type of model are called logistic model and multilabel models.

**_Myth:_**  [machine learning](https://hackernoon.com/machine-learning-is-the-emperor-wearing-clothes-59933d12a3cc) is not a magical box of magic.
 
# ONA (Organisational Network Analysis)

ONA shows “who is talking with who” to figure out how organizations work. Tools for ONA include surveys, systems that monitor email traffic, and more complex applications that look at all types of communication (email, text messages, feedback, conversations).
